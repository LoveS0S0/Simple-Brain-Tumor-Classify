# Simple-Brain-Tumor-Classify
Made a CNN using TensorFlow Keras on Python that detects brain tumors using a public MRI Dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset/data).
The model had an approximate accuracy of 96% on its own data, but did not do very well with outside data.
